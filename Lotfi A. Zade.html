				About the Super-brain
			</h1><p>	☛ Zadeh was born on February 4,1921 in Baku,Azerbaijan as Lotfi Aliaskerzadeh.<br><br>
				☛  His father was Rahim Aleskerzade, an Iranian Muslim Azerbaijani journalist from Ardabil on assignment from Iran and his mother was Fanya  Korenman, a Jewish pediatrician from Odessa, Ukraine, who was an Iranian citizen.<br><br>
				☛ Today, 6 important theories of Lutfi Zadeh are known to world science. Currently, they are widely used in science and industry. His theory of fuzzy logic, which is considered a revolution in world science, brought him world fame.<br><br>
				☛ This theory is a new expression for the concept of binary set, which is the basis of mathematics: fuzzy set. It allows for the inclusion of fuzzy dimensions in science and the uncertainty of risk in society to be more adequately captured.
				<br><br> ☛This theory, applied by leading world companies, was developed in 1965. The theory has long accepted American scientific development, and it was only in the 80s of the century that it attracted the attention of Japanese scientists, and the Japanese came to take advantage of this unique theory. The application of Lutfi Zade's theory has earned the country billions. Today, Japan's Mitsubishi, Toshiba, Sony, Canon, Sanyo, Nissan, Honda and other reputable companies are manufacturing photo and video cameras, washing machines, and vacuum cleaners based on fuzzy logic theory , widely used in the management of cars, trains, industrial processes. In 1989, Lutfi Zadeh was awarded with the highest award given to Japanese scientists - "Honda" award for the success of the theory of fuzzy logic in the industry. Americans have also begun to understand the value of this theory and take advantage of it. Today, this theory is widely applied in the production of the American companies "General Motors", "General Electric", "Motorola", "Dupont", "Kodak" and others. Currently, this theory is used in economics, psychology, linguistics, politics, philosophy, sociology, religious administration, and conflict problems.
				<br><br> ☛In addition to the theory of fuzzy logic, Lutfi Zade offers 5 fundamental scientific theories: "theory of impressions", "theory of systems", "theory of word processing computer", "theory of optimal filters" and "soft computing".
				<br><br>☛Lutfi Zadeh's work, known in science as Z-transformation, is a scientific theory that laid the foundations for the creation of discrete and control management, information and communication systems. His important state space, control and observation theories of dynamic systems form the foundations of modern management science. The US National Space Agency (NASA) researches, designs and implements these theories of basic control systems.<br><br>
				☛Lutfi Zade's fuzzy logic can be figuratively explained as follows: the brain that judges with "Aristotle's logic" perceives the world only in black and white, creating "Zade's logic" allows us to perceive the world in all its shades. Because "Aristotle's logic" is a binary logic, "Zade's logic" is a multi-valued logic. According to Aristotle, a proposition can be either true or false. According to Lutfi Zadeh, the truth of each proposition takes continuous values between one true or false (or between zero and one). In the "noble logic" there is more to see real life honestly, to build tolerance in this logic. Fuzzy logic theory, which was not accepted in American scientific development for exactly 20 years, finally received great interest from Japanese financial scientists in 1980. Thus, this theory opened a new era in the history of the development of mathematics, cybernetics, informatics and computing technology. This theory permeates science, technology and technology all over the world. It has found its application in hundreds of control systems and devices, from washing machines to automatic drives. Increasingly, the practical power of the theory has surpassed its abstract essence.On June 19-20, 2013, a presentation ceremony of the awards established in the field of science and culture of the BBVA (Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, S.A.) fund of the city was held in Madrid. Lutfi Zade was awarded a prize of 400 thousand euros in the Information and Communication Technologies section of the Fund.
